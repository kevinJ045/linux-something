To make it work, if you use zsh do `nano .zshrc` or if bash `nano .bashrc`... if fish i have no idea.
and then..
```bash
PATH="/home/workspace/bin/:$PATH"
```
Now replace all occurencies of /home/workspace/bin with the folder of your choice (Empty folder recommended) and the copy all the commands in thisrepo/bin there ad done, you're all set
